Getting and Cleaning Data Project
----

This project demonstrates the ability to collect, work with, and clean
a data set. It includes a script that takes a raw dataset as input and
outputs a tidy dataset that can be used for later analysis.

The raw data for the project are linked
[here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). They
are data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S
smartphone. A full description is available
[here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
at the site where the data was obtained.

Project Files
----

- README.md: This file explaining the files in the project.
- run_analysis.R: An R script that reads in the raw dataset and outputs a tidy dataset.
- CodeBook.md: A code book describing the variables, data, and transformations performed to clean up the data.

Instructions
----

1. Download the raw dataset linked above and unzip it in your working
directory.
1. Run the "run_analysis.R" R script from your working directory.
1. Look for the output file, "tidy.txt", in your working directory.
1. Refer to "CookBook.md" to interpret the tidy data.

The script will output a "tidy.txt" tidy dataset file.
